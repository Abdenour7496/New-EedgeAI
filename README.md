# EedgeAI

EedgeAI is a local-first agent and retrieval stack. Graphiti provides temporal knowledge extraction and hybrid retrieval, FalkorDB stores the graph and vectors, OpenClaw provides agent tools, Open WebUI provides chat, and MinIO preserves original documents.

Conversational agents use OpenAI Codex first, Claude Code second, and local Ollama as the final fallback. Graphiti extraction and embeddings remain on Ollama by default because they are background OpenAI-compatible API workloads, separate from the interactive Codex and Claude Code runtimes.

## Current architecture

```text
Open WebUI / Knowledge UI / OpenClaw
                  |
             RAG proxy
                  |
              Graphiti
        (episodes, entities, facts)
                  |
              FalkorDB
          (graph + vectors)
```

Neo4j, Qdrant, and the Buzz collaboration stack are no longer active services. Their old Docker volumes are intentionally retained by name for rollback/export; the new services do not mount or modify them.

## Feasibility and trade-offs

Graphiti officially supports FalkorDB and combines graph traversal, semantic similarity, keyword search, temporal validity, and episode provenance in one retrieval layer. This simplifies the former dual-write Qdrant/Neo4j path and removes cross-database consistency failures.

The material constraint is extraction quality: Graphiti requires an LLM that reliably returns structured JSON. The default local model is `qwen2.5:7b`; smaller local models were not reliable enough in validation. Allocate at least 12 GB RAM to Docker (16 GB recommended). For better extraction quality, point `GRAPHITI_API_BASE_URL`, `GRAPHITI_API_KEY`, and `GRAPHITI_MODEL` at an OpenAI-compatible hosted model.

This cutover does not automatically transform legacy Neo4j/Qdrant data. Re-ingest source documents to populate Graphiti. Legacy volumes are retained until migration has been accepted.

## Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

The first start downloads Qwen 2.5 7B, Nomic Embed Text, Llama 3.2, and LLaVA, so it can take several minutes.

## Services

| Service | URL / port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Knowledge UI / proxy | http://localhost:5001/knowledge | ingest, browse, search, RAG API |
| Open WebUI | http://localhost:8080 | chat UI |
| Graphiti REST | http://localhost:8000/docs | knowledge ingestion and retrieval |
| FalkorDB Browser | http://localhost:3001 | graph inspection |
| FalkorDB | localhost:6379 | graph/vector database |
| MinIO console | http://localhost:9001 | original documents |
| OpenClaw | http://localhost:18799 | agent gateway |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 | metrics |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 | dashboards |

## Knowledge API

```bash
curl -F "file=@report.pdf" -F "collection=documents" http://localhost:5001/api/ingest
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/search?q=your+question&collection=documents"
```

The MinIO watcher also processes objects placed under `documents/inbox/`.

## Operations

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml ps
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml logs -f graphiti graphiti-mcp falkordb proxy
curl http://localhost:8000/healthcheck
docker exec eedgeai-falkordb-1 redis-cli PING
```

Graphiti groups replace Qdrant collections. A group is materialized on first ingest. Renaming groups is intentionally unsupported; deleting a group deletes its Graphiti episodes and facts.

## Configuration

See `.env.example`. The important settings are `GRAPHITI_API_BASE_URL`, `GRAPHITI_MODEL`, `GRAPHITI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `GRAPHITI_EMBEDDING_DIM`, and `GRAPHITI_GROUP_ID`. Do not commit `.env` or credentials.
